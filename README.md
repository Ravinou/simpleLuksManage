# What is it ?

ðŸ“œ Two very simple scripts to manage the mount/unmount of a **LUKS** partition in a Logical Volume (**LVM**) and having an alert in case of unmount. It works for **Debian**.

# Which scripts ?

1. The first script allows you to manage your LUKS containers in a more pleasant way during maintenance or reboot of a server.

2. The second script allows you to be alerted twice a day when LUKS partition is not mounted. You will find the instructions in comments.
